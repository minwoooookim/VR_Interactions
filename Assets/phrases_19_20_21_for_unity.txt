time to go shopping
the world is a stage
do not say anything
the force is with you
are you talking to me
all work and no play
do not drink too much
take a coffee break
starlight and dewdrop
call for more details
have a good weekend
buckle up for safety
life is but a dream
the sum of the parts
he is shouting loudly
my dog sheds his hair
join us on the patio
santa claus got stuck
zero in on the facts
we park in driveways
i like to play tennis
it looks like a shack
the daring young man
you have my sympathy
he called seven times
