time to go shopping
the world is a stage
the power of denial
do not say anything
the force is with you
are you talking to me
all work and no play
do not drink too much
take a coffee break
starlight and dewdrop
but the levee was dry
call for more details
have a good weekend
buckle up for safety
life is but a dream
batman wears a cape
nobody cares anymore
the sum of the parts
peek out the window
toss the ball around
he is shouting loudly
my dog sheds his hair
join us on the patio
the dog will bite you
santa claus got stuck
zero in on the facts
we drive on parkways
we park in driveways
i like to play tennis
it looks like a shack
the daring young man
you have my sympathy
he called seven times
sad to hear that news
